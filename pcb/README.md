# PCB Status

This prototype does not use a custom PCB.

Instead, it is built from:
- Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 IO board (or equivalent)
- External HDMI capture hardware
- USB gadget mode via CM4 USB OTG

A custom carrier board is planned as a future revision after prototype validation.
See hardware/architecture.md for details.
